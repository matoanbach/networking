# network

## routers
- Have fewer network interfaces than switches.
- Are used to provide connectivity between LANs.
- Are therefore used to send data over the Internet.

## switches

- Provide connectivity to hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network).
- Do not provide connectivity between LANs over the Internet.

## firewalls
- Monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
- Can be placed `inside` the network, or `outside the network`.
- Are known as `Next-Generation Firewalls` when they include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.
